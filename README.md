# Amazon-Lex-Happy-Birthday-Bot

This project aims to show you how to use AWS services to implement a proactive HappyBirthdayBot, integrating Amazon Lex as a conversational interface, Slack as a messaging channel, and BambooHR as a source of birthday dates.

Before start, these are some concept you might familiar with

+ [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text.
+ [BambooHR](https://www.bamboohr.com/) is a technology company that provides human resources software as a service.
+ [Slack](https://slack.com/) is a communication platform developed by the software company Slack Technologies.



## How it works

The Birthday Bot is an integration of Amazon services with Slack. The logic of the bot is based on Lambda functions and AWS Lexbot. The bot works in two ways:

**Responding to a Slack conversation:** The AWS Lex bot has three intents configured, each of them has one lambda function behind. These intents allows the bot to greet, respond the birthdays of the day and configurate the channel where proactive messages will be posted.

When the user configures the channel, the lambda function triggered by this intent writes on a S3 bucket file, storing the configured channel.

**Sending proactive messages:** A Lambda function is triggered by EventBridge (CloudWatch Events). It reads the configured channel on the S3 file, the birthdays of the day, and post it to the channel. The authentication tokens for Slack are stored on Parameter Store inside AWS System Manager.
